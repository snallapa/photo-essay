        <h1 class="title">What does music mean to you</h1>
        <p class="text">
            What I was interested in finding out through this project was other people’s thoughts on music and how willing they
            would be to tell a random person. From the simple and open ended question “what does music mean to you,” I found 12
            different answers of how music has affected people’s lives and found surprising amount of detail in their answers. I
            tried capturing the emotions throughout the short interview as they thought through the admittedly difficult opening
            question. Each person has the song they were currently listening to while the interview was happening added for your
            pleasure.

            I think it’s only just to end this with asking myself the question I uncomfortably (for both parties honestly) forced
            onto others. What does music mean to me? Music is a way of storytelling, something I love and feel is one of the
            strongest ways to connect with other people. It helps me push through hard times and brightens the good ones as well.
            Music can turn around my mood and give me the confidence get through rejection (like people saying no to being
            interviewed). It has helped me in almost every aspect of my life and at this point, I cannot imagine what I would be
            without it.
